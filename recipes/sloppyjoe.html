        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          A Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in a
          tomato-based sauce served on a hamburger bun. The sandwich likely
          originated in Sioux City, Iowa in the 1930s. According to legend, the
          "loose meat sandwich" was the creation of a cook named Joe.
